# No-Show-medical-appointments
## by Ahmed Tryaq


## Dataset

Our dataset contains records of medical appointments in which nearly 30% of patients didn't show up for their appointments. Using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, my aim in this investigation is to find which variables are likely to be related with this phenomena and to identify which variebles would be most important in predicting whether the patient would attend his/hir appointment or not.

## Summary of Findings

- 1 of each 5 appointments is missed. The most important features affecting missing appointment probability may be whether the patient received SMS or not, neighborhood of the hospital, and patient age. Other factors like scholarship, handicap may have some correlation.


- Provisional exploration showed a probabilty of negative correlation between recieving an SMS and attending the appointment.
It seems that patients living in some neighborhoods have missed their appointments more than others.


- Teenagers have the highest risk to miss their appointment compared to other age categories, but this conclusion needs further in detail assessment, examination of correlation with ANOVA test would be an appropriate way to examine the correlation between age and missing appointments.

## Key Insights for Presentation

1- How many appointments were canceled in total? <br>
2- In general, which categories seem to be related most with successful and unsuccessful appointments?
